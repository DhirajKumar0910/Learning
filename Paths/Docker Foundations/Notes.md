# Containers vs Virtual Machines

| Aspect                  | Containers                                                                 | Virtual Machines                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**           | Lightweight, OS-level virtualization running isolated processes           | Full virtualization with a hypervisor running complete guest operating systems   |
| **Architecture**         | Share the host OS kernel; use container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd) | Each VM runs on a hypervisor with its own guest OS, kernel, and virtual hardware |
| **Isolation**            | Process-level isolation (namespaces, cgroups)                             | Strong isolation with full OS-level boundaries                                   |
| **Performance**          | Near-native performance; low overhead                                     | Higher overhead due to virtualization of hardware and OS                         |
| **Boot Time**            | Starts in seconds (since no OS boot required)                             | Slower (minutes) as each VM boots its own OS                                     |
| **Resource Usage**       | Lightweight; uses fewer resources (RAM, CPU, disk)                        | Heavyweight; requires more resources (full OS per VM)                            |
| **Portability**          | Highly portable across environments (same image works everywhere)         | Less portable; tied to hypervisor and guest OS compatibility                     |
| **Use Cases**            | Microservices, CI/CD, rapid scaling, lightweight apps                     | Legacy apps, monolithic workloads, OS-specific requirements, full system testing |
| **Management**           | Managed with container orchestrators (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)           | Managed with hypervisors (VMware, Hyper-V, KVM)                                 |
| **Security**             | Weaker isolation (depends on kernel security)                             | Stronger isolation (dedicated OS per VM)                                         |
| **Storage & Networking** | Uses layered file systems, shared volumes, virtual networks               | Full virtual disks, dedicated NIC emulation                                      |
